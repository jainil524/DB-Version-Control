The **Database Version Control App** is an ongoing project designed to manage database schema changes and version control in a manner similar to Git. It supports features like branching, merging, and rollbacks, helping teams work collaboratively on databases without conflicting changes.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Schema & Data Versioning**: Track and control changes made to database schemas and data.
- **Branching & Merging**: Enable parallel database development and seamlessly merge changes.
- **Rollback Capabilities**: Easily revert to previous database states when needed.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated database migrations that fit into development pipelines.
- **Custom Migration Scripts**: Users can create their own migration scripts for added flexibility.

> **Status**: Ongoing project with regular updates and improvements.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language for building and scripting.
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for handling database connections and queries.
- **Alembic**: Tool for handling migrations.
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL | MySQL | SQLite.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/db-version-control.git
cd db-version-control
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure `.env` for Database Connection

Create and configure your `.env` file for database connections:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost/dbname
```

### 4. Apply Initial Migrations

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

## üöÄ Usage

### 1. **Initialize Database Versioning**

```bash
python main.py init
```

### 2. **Commit Changes**

After making database schema changes, commit them:

```bash
python main.py commit -m "Your commit message"
```

### 3. **Checkout to a Specific Version**

```bash
python main.py checkout <version_number>
```

### 4. **Create a Branch**

```bash
python main.py branch <branch_name>
```

### 5. **Merge Changes**

```bash
python main.py merge <branch_name>
```

  User-->CommitChanges[Commit Schema Changes]
  CommitChanges-->MigrationScripts[Apply Migration Scripts]
  MigrationScripts-->Branching[Merged/Branching]
  Branching-->Rollback[Rollback if necessary]
```

1. User commits schema/data changes.
2. Migration scripts are applied to the database.
3. Changes can be merged or branched into new versions.
4. Rollback allows reverting to previous stable versions.

## üìê Design and UI

The interface is minimalistic, focusing on functionality and clear workflows. Below is a basic layout preview of the system:

```
+------------------------------------------------+
|               Database Versioning              |
|                                                |
|  [Commit Changes]                             |
|  [Branch Management]                          |
|  [Rollback to Previous Version]               |
+------------------------------------------------+
```

Tailwind CSS is used for sleek styling and responsive design. Additional UI features are planned for upcoming updates.

## üß© Future Improvements

- **NoSQL Support**: Add support for NoSQL databases like MongoDB.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Enhance conflict resolution during merging.
- **UI Development**: Develop a web-based interface for easier usage.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Add benchmarking and tests for large datasets.
