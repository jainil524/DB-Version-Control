📚 Database Version Control System (Ongoing Project)

    

🎯 Project Overview

This Database Version Control System is designed to handle the complexities of database schema and data changes with features inspired by Git. It ensures smooth collaboration across teams, simplifies database management, and integrates seamlessly with existing CI/CD pipelines.

Features:

📝 Version Control: Track changes to database schemas and data.

🔀 Branching & Merging: Support for parallel development and merging of changes.

⏪ Rollback: Easy rollback to previous database states.

🚀 CI/CD Integration: Automate database migrations in the development pipeline.

🛠️ Custom Migration Scripts: Support for user-defined scripts for changes and rollbacks.


> Note: This project is currently in progress, with more features and improvements coming soon!



💻 Tech Stack

Languages: Python

Databases: PostgreSQL | MySQL | SQLite

Tools: SQLAlchemy, Alembic (for migrations)

Version Control: Git


📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/db-version-control.git
cd db-version-control


2. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Create and configure your .env file for database connections:

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost/dbname


4. Apply migrations:

alembic upgrade head



🚀 Usage

1. Initialize Database Versioning

To initialize the version control on your database:

python main.py init

2. Commit Changes

After making database schema changes, commit them:

python main.py commit -m "Your commit message"

3. Checkout to a Specific Version

To checkout to a previous version:

python main.py checkout <version_number>

4. Create Branch

To create a new branch for parallel development:

python main.py branch <branch_name>

5. Merge Branch

To merge changes from a branch into the main version:

python main.py merge <branch_name>

🛠️ Key Features & Modules

Version Control: Manages and tracks database changes.

Migration Management: Automatically applies or rolls back migration scripts.

Branching & Merging: Supports development across multiple branches, similar to Git.


🛤️ Roadmap

[ ] Add support for NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB)

[ ] Implement conflict resolution during merges

[ ] Provide a web-based UI for easier management

[ ] Create detailed documentation and tutorials

[ ] Add tests for performance benchmarking
